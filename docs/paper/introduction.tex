\section{Introduction}
Face animation is closely related to our life and is always a hot topic in computer graphics. In this project, we want to do something related to facial animation. Time being quite limited, we tried to implement many features of facial animation as fast as possible. Some of our implementation may be approximate but are efficient as well. 
\subsection{Structure of the report}
In the following parts of the report, we will first introduce different basic components related to facial animation we have implemented. Then we will talk about different interesting facial animation application using some of basic components we have implemented. At the end of the report, we will discuss further possible improments of our project.
