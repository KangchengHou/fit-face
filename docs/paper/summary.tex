\section{Summary}
In this project, we have implemented the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single/Joint Face fitting \cite{yang2011expression}
\item Laplacian Surface Editing \cite{sorkine2004laplacian}
\item Poisson Image Editing \cite{perez2003poisson}
\item Formulate our problem into graph cut\cite{yang2011expression} and solve it using GCO library \cite{boykov2004experimental}
\item ARAP shape manipulation \cite{igarashi2005rigid}
\end{itemize}
Most importantly, we integate the techniques above to make two interesting applications.
