\section{Summary}
In this project, we have implemented the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Single/Joint Face fitting \cite{yang2011expression}
\item Laplacian Surface Editing \cite{sorkine2004laplacian}
\item Poisson Image Editing \cite{perez2003poisson}
\item Formulate our problem into graph cut\cite{yang2011expression} and solve it using GCO library \cite{boykov2004experimental}
\item ARAP shape manipulation \cite{igarashi2005rigid}
\item \textbf{Combine the above all together}
\end{itemize}
Based on these techniques we have implemented, we build two interesting applications. The first one is facial component transfer and the second one is easy face editing.
