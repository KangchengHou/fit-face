\section{Code structure}
The code structure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{src/arap} contains the code of implementation of \cite{igarashi2005rigid}.
\item \texttt{src/fitmodel} contains the code of implementation of single image fitting and joint shape fitting, described in \cite{yang2011expression}.
\item \texttt{src/seamless\_composite} contains the code of implementation of seamless compositing of two images, described in \cite{agarwala2004interactive}.
\item \texttt{src/poisson\_blend} contains the code of implementation of poisson image editing, described in \cite{perez2003poisson}.
\item \texttt{src/demo} contains the code of two demos built on top of the techniques described above.
\end{itemize}
