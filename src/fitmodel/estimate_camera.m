function camera = estimate_camera( xp,x )
%POS Estimate scaled orthographic projection parameters from 2D-3D
%correspondences
%   xp - 2*n matrix of 2D feature point positions
%   x  - 3*n matrix of 3D feature point positions
%   R, s, t - rotation, scale, translate parameters
%
% The algorithm is loosely based on the first iteration of the POSIT
% algorithm, although I enforce a valid rotation matrix via SVD. This
% function only provides a linear estimate and the reprojection error can
% be improved by subsequently refining the pose estimates using a
% non-linear optimiser. This is achieved by RefineOrthoCam.
%
% Note that SOP has 6 DOF: 3 for rotation, 2 for 2D translation, 1 for
% scale so 3 2D-3D correspondences should be enough. However, our linear
% solution does not enforce any constraints on the 8 estimated parameters
% and so a minimum of 4 points are required.
